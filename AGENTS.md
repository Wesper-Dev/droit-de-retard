# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains a local-first EU261 claim-preparation prototype.

- `agent.py`: Gemma 4 vision/audio extraction, routing, research, and letter
  pipeline.
- `eu261.py`: deterministic distance, compensation, and ticket-refund rules.
- `tools.py`: privacy-minimized SerpApi searches and offline recovery.
- `app.py` and `static/index.html`: local demo and optional microphone dictation.
- `test_agent.py`: deterministic unit tests.
- `billet_avion_fictif.pdf`: fictional demo input.
- `knowledge/airline_policies/`: optional versioned airline-procedure corpus.
- `ROADMAP.md`: audit findings, technical debt and planned work. Historical
  hackathon documents live frozen in `docs/hackathon/`: status,
  priorities, ownership, and parallel work packages.

Keep legal calculations in `eu261.py`; Gemma must extract or draft, never
invent eligibility rules. Do not commit `.env`, `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, or
temporary rendered documents.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

There is no build step and runtime Python uses the standard library. PDF
rendering needs Poppler; optional browser dictation needs FFmpeg.

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull gemma4:12b
.venv/bin/python -m unittest -v test_agent.py
./demo.sh
.venv/bin/python agent.py billet_avion_fictif.pdf \
  --incident "Le vol est arrivé avec 3 h 25 de retard."
```

The interface is available at `http://127.0.0.1:7865`. Online research
requires `SERPAPI_KEY` in the launching process. Never print or commit it.

## Coding Style & Testing

Target Python 3.10+, PEP 8, four-space indentation, `snake_case` names, type
annotations for public helpers, and explicit network timeouts. Preserve French
user-facing text. Add deterministic coverage to `test_agent.py`; run all tests
after changes to routing, rules, parsing, or research. Ollama integration tests
must be sequential because concurrent runs distort latency. Tool calls must use
an explicit allow-list and validated arguments; retain a deterministic fallback.
Audio must remain local, must never be persisted, and its transcription must be
confirmed before it affects routing.

## Agent Coordination & Review

Read `ROADMAP.md` before editing. Work only inside the
assigned file set; the main agent owns core P0 files until the demo is frozen.
External agents must not change this guide. Contributions should
state files changed, commands run, observed results, assumptions, and remaining
risks. Use short imperative commit subjects, for example
`docs: add Kaggle writeup`.

Pull requests must describe user-visible behavior, tests performed,
configuration needs, and any SerpApi quota impact. Do not claim guaranteed
compensation or legal representation.
